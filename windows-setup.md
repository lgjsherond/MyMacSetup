# Individual Tool Installation:

For Windows, you'll likely need to download and install each tool from their official websites:

* Brave Browser: https://brave.com/
* k6: https://loadimpact.com/
* Fiddler classic : https://www.telerik.com/fiddler/fiddler-classic
* Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Chocolatey (Optional):

If you prefer a package manager like Homebrew on Windows, consider using Chocolatey: https://chocolatey.org/. It allows managing various software through a command-line interface. However, some tools may not be available through Chocolatey:

Install Chocolatey: https://chocolatey.org/install

Install Tools (if available):

```

PowerShell

choco install k6

```

**Use code with caution**

You can use the following PowerShell script to install the necessary tools on your Windows machine:

```
powershell
# Install Chocolatey (if not already installed)
if (-not (Get-Command choco -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)) {
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; 
    [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; 
    iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
}

# Install k6

Save this script to a file with a .ps1 extension and run it in PowerShell with administrative privileges to install the listed tools.
